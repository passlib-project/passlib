Modular Crypt Format
====================
A vast majority of the schemes used on unix systems (and supported by this library)
follow the "Modular Crypt Format", introduced around the time :mod:`~passlib.hash.md5_crypt` was developed.
This scheme allows hashes generates by multiple schemes to co-exist within a database,
by requiring that all hash string begin with a unique prefix ``$identifier$``;
where ``identifier`` is a short alphanumeric string globally identifying
hashes generated by that algorithm.

While not part of the specification, most modular crypt -compatible hashes
were designed to be used by unix systems to store user account passwords
in ``/etc/passwd`` or ``/etc/shadow``. Because of this, most of them
follow another defacto limitations: they avoid using the characters
``:``, ``\n``, and ``\x00`` anywhere in their encoded hash.
In fact, for the most part they avoid using any characters except
``a-zA-Z0-9./``, and ``$`` as an internal separator, though
this can be violated on some systems if the user intervenes.

.. note::
    :mod:`passlib.hash.des_crypt` and :mod:`passlib.hash.ext_des_crypt`
    do not follow this protocol, since they predate it by many years.
