Library Overview
================

BPS started life in 2003 as an in-house collection of small functions
and tools which were frequently needed by the programmers at
`Assurance Technologies <http://www.assurancetechnologies.com>`_.
Over the years, it has accumlated a more small functions,
but it has also acquired some modules which provide major
new features that go above and beyond simple utility functions.
Since we have benefited greatly from open source software,
this library was released publically in 2009, in order
to fill a few niches for which there is a need (password hashing,
desktop interaction), as well as to simply give something
back to the community.
